Graphics routines can more efficiently process polygons than other kinds of fill shapes
- because polygon boundaries are described with linear equations.

Most curved surfaces can be approximated reasonably well with a set of polygon patches
- just as a curved line can be approximated with a set of straight-line segments.
- In addition, when lighting effects and surface-shading procedures are applied, an approximated curved surface can be displayed quite realistically.
- this, i.e. *approximating a curved surface with polygon facets, is a.k.a.:
  - ***surface tessellation***, or,
  - fitting the surface with a ***polygon mesh***
  - which display of figures can be generated quickly as wire-frame views
    - showing only the polygon edges to give a general indication of the surface structure.
    - which can then be shaded to generate a display a natural-looking material surface.
- These objects (described with a set of polygon surface patches) are usually referred to as:
  - standard graphics objects
  - graphics objects
