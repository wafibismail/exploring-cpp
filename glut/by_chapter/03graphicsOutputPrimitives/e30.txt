Using a circle function, write a routine to display
a pie chart with appropriate labeling. Input to the
routine is to include a data set giving the distri-
bution of the data over some set of intervals, the
name of the pie chart, and the names of the inter-
vals. Each section label is to be displayed outside
the boundary of the pie chart near the correspond-
ing pie section.
