**Instruction:** <br>
Set up geometric data tables for a square pyra- <br>
mid using just a vertex table and a surface-facet <br>
table, then store the same information using just <br>
the surface-facet table. Compare the two methods <br>
for representing the unit cube with a representa- <br>
tion using the three tables in the previous exercise. <br>
Estimate the storage requirements for each. <br>
<br>

**Response 1/2:**
```
VERTEX TABLE   SURFACE-FACET TABLE
V1: 0, 0, 0    S1: V1, V2, V3, V4
V2: 2, 0, 0    S2: V1, V5, V2
V3: 2, 0, 2    S3: V2, V5, V3
V4: 0, 0, 2    S4: V3, V5, V4
V5: 1, 1, 1    S5: E4, V5, E1
```

Compared to the table sets that include the EDGE TABLE,
the above set cuts down the space requirement by 1/3 of the initial requirement, 31 units of storage as opposed to 47 (assuming pointers for vertices take as much storage as the individual coordinate points)

**Response 2/2:**
```
SURFACE-FACET TABLE
S1: [[0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2]]
S2: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 0]]
S3: [[2, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 2]]
S4: [[2, 0, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2]]
S5: [[2, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
```

This set requires 48 units of storage, roughly the same as the set with all tables for vertices, edges, and surface-facets <br>
