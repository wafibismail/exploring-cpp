Write a procedure to display a line graph for any
input set of data points in any selected area of
the screen, with the input data set scaled to fit
the selected screen area. Data points are to be
displayed as asterisks joined with straight-line
segments, and the x and y axes are to be labeled
according to input specifications. (Instead of aster-
isks, small circles or some other symbols could be
used to plot the data points.)
