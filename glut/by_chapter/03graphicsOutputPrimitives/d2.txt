Choose one of the concave polygons you generated
in the previous exercise and set up the vertex, edge,
and surface facet tables for the shape as described
in Section 7. Now split the shape it into a set of
convex polygons using the vector method given in
the same section. Then split each of the resulting
convex polygons into a set of triangles using the
method described in Section 7 as well. Finally,
set up the vertex, edge, and surface facet tables
for the resulting set of triangles. Compare the two
table sets and the amount of memory needed to
store each.
