For this exercise, draw a rough sketch of what a
single “snapshot” of your application might look
like and write a program to display this snapshot.
Choose a background color and default window
size. Make sure the snapshot includes at least a
few objects. Represent each object as a polygonal
approximation to the true object. Use a different
shape for each object type. Represent at least one
of the objects as a concave polygon. Make each
object its own color distinct from the background
color. It is a good idea to write a separate function
for each object (or each object type) in which
you define the representation. Use display lists to
create and display each object. Include a display
window reshape function to redraw the scene
appropriately if the window is if the window is
resized.
